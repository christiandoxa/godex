# Godex versus Prodex 0.438.3 — behavioral parity

**Target:** published Prodex release `0.438.3` only. Tagged source commit:
`42042d765100fc06895a27e0904ffb64842092e6`. Official Linux x86_64
binary `prodex-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` published SHA-256:
`5efa06fef57b0026eae7ec3cad23ac76b40c3e5d8a3afaee6c20feaeb5737923`.
Published `release-manifest.json` SHA-256:
`300a8f046041a95f9757e4cbdb72917d37927683b6e1af442492254e2f1a37da`.
The tags, GitHub release manifest and checksum were checked independently;
the verified pinned executable reports `prodex 0.438.3`.

The previous source-pinned `0.438.2` finite gate is documented separately
in `PARITY-04382.md`. Its release result must not be counted as passing
0.438.3 without executing the new binary/tag against a clean Godex commit.

## Delta from 0.438.2

The official `docs/release-notes/0.438.3.md` describes changes to:

- **WebSocket precommit transport recovery:** handshake, send, read and close
  errors are typed attempt outcomes. The outer affinity-aware routing owner
  alone authorizes safe cross-profile recovery; lower transports cannot
  bypass continuity or close the client prematurely.
- **Turn-state-only full-history recovery:** with no `previous_response_id`, a
  safe complete transcript can replay on an eligible Ready profile after an
  uncommitted transport failure. The failed turn binding is removed from
  headers, request metadata and persisted affinity before recovery; delta-only
  input and strict compact-followup are not eligible.
- **Quiet-stream liveness and deadlines:** bounded Ping control frames may
  keep the client alive during upstream metadata holds without committing
  output, extending the logical request deadline, resetting upstream
  progress or changing quota. Poll readiness is nonblocking on Unix and
  Windows, preserving partial TLS/WebSocket frames and socket receive state.
- **Readiness before idle decisions:** buffered `response.completed` and
  `response.failed` frames win over a stale idle-clock calculation. OS
  readiness checks themselves do not renew progress.
- **Credential keyrings and internal Mojo/domain policies:** maintenance of
  native OS stores and new compiled policy projections. Changes are scoped
  to observable behavior; raw Rust/Mojo refactors do not require Go rewrites
  when the existing client contract is already equivalent.

## First source-derived fix — transport-only full-history turn-state rotation

`internal/usecase/routing/websocket_transport_fullhistory_04383.go` implements
only the bounded 0.438.3 recovery decision for a WebSocket response failure
that is a typed **precommit transport** outcome (not a quota or application
failure). It requires a reconstructable full-history request, a turn-state
binding **verified** to belong to the failed profile and another independently
Ready same-provider profile. Only then does it release the failed turn/session
binding, remove the stale `x-codex-turn-state` from both HTTP headers and
nested request metadata, preserve the request's original full input and
deadline, and replay on the selected other owner.

`TestProdex04383TransportBoundTurnStateFullHistoryRotatesToReadyProfile`
reproduced the previous Godex behavior: a full-history turn remained on its
failed transport owner and returned HTTP 502 even though another synthetic
profile was Ready. It now passes with a single safely moved full-history
turn and exactly one new inference on the alternate Ready profile.
`TestProdex04383TransportTurnStateDeltaOnlyRemainsBound` and
`TestProdex04383TransportFullHistoryRejectsUnsafeRotationVariants` protect
previous-response references, delta-only tool output, realtime duplex,
strict compact-followup, committed output, quota-specific recovery, exhausted
retry budget, missing affinity ownership, negative cached quota evidence and
absent alternative profiles. These checks passed repeated Go `-race` runs
with synthetic identities and no real credentials or model requests.

**Scope:** this first stage is tagged-source/local Router parity only, not
an independent two-executable 0.438.3 network recovery certificate. Further
work must verify the release's typed connection/send/read/close failures and
full-history replay using the official binary; the existing 0.438.2 gate is
currently historical until re-pinned and re-executed. Overall production 1:1
remains **PARTIAL**, including native Windows/macOS and live OAuth behavior.

## Typed upstream WebSocket precommit transport failures

Prodex 0.438.3 returns typed **attempt outcomes** when precommit connection,
send, read or upstream close fails. Previously Godex's `ExecuteWebSocketMessage`
returned raw Go errors for fresh handshake failures and for read/close errors
on hard turn-state, previous-response or compact/session-bound requests.
Those errors escaped the typed precommit classifier, potentially closing the
local client before its affinity-aware recovery owner considered whether
safe replay was permitted. A source-derived transport regression failed on
all three hard-affinity read/close cases and on an unopened upstream socket.

The OpenAI WebSocket adapter now returns `websocketTransportFailure` with
`PrecommitFailure.Transport=true`, `FirstEventCommitted=false`, HTTP 502 and
an empty client-visible precommit body for all non-canceled connection,
send and read errors. A canceled context still preserves the original
`ctx.Err()`; the realtime duplex branch still uses its distinct committed
lifecycle. The transport **never** grants permission to rotate credentials,
replay a previous-response dependency or bypass quota. Routing owns those
decisions. `TestProdex04383BoundWebSocketUpstreamReadFailureIsTypedAttempt`,
`TestProdex04383WebSocketFailedHandshakeReturnsTypedPrecommitAttempt` and
`TestProdex04383PartialPrecommitWebSocketFrameIsTypedNotCommitted` prove the
bounded behavior against actual local TCP/WebSocket connections, including
a truncated payload header followed by EOF. The latter's partial bytes must
never be promoted to committed output. All focused tests and race detection
PASS, as do the existing noncommitted/committed owner-retry regression suites.

These tests establish **source-derived local adapter parity**, not a full
published Prodex 0.438.3 two-executable transport recovery oracle. The
subsequent release gate must pin and exercise the actual new binary to
qualify cross-product behavior; release 0.438.2 differential logs cannot
be substituted.
